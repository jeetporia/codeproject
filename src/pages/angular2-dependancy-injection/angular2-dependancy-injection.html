      <h2>Dependancy Injection in Angular2 </h2>

      <p>
        In this video we will discuss
        <br> 1. What is Dependency Injection
        <br> 2. How dependency injection works in angular
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us understand Dependency Injection in Angular with an example. Consider this piece of code in EmployeeListComponent.
      </p>

      <expandable hideText="Hide the code" showText="See the code">
        <textarea class="codepart" cols="65" rows="10">
          export class EmployeeListComponent implements OnInit { 
            
            private _employeeService: EmployeeService; 
            constructor(_employeeService: EmployeeService) { 
              this._employeeService = _employeeService; 
            } 
            
            ngOnInit() { 
              this._employeeService.getEmployees() 
              .subscribe( employeesData => this.employees = employeesData, 
              error => this.statusMessage = 'Error'); 
            } 

          // Rest of the code 
          } 
        </textarea>
      </expandable>

      <p>
        1. We register a service with the angular injector by using the providers property of @Component decorator or @NgModule decorator.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. When a component in Angular needs a service instance, it does not explicitly create it. Instead it just specifies it has
        a dependency on a service and needs an instance of it by including the service as a constructor parameter.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fullpage_content">
      <p>
        3. When an instance of the component is created, the angular injector creates an instance of the service class and provides
        it to component constructor.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. So the component which is dependent on a service instance, receives the instance from an external source rather than creating
        it itself. This is called Dependency Injection.
      </p>

      <h2> What is Dependancy Injection</h2>

      <p>
        It's a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        So if we relate this definition to our example, EmployeeListComponent has a dependency on EmployeeService. The EmployeeListComponent
        receives the dependency instance (i.e EmployeeService instance) from the the external source (i.e the angular injector)
        rather than creating the instance itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        1. Why should we use Dependency Injection?
        <br> 2. What benefits it provide?
        <br> 3. Why can't we explicitly create an instance of the EmployeeService class using the new keyword and use that instance
        instead in our EmployeeListComponent?
