      <h2>Why do we need Service in Angular2 </h2>

      <p>
        A service in Angular is generally used when you need to reuse data or logic across multiple components. Anytime you see logic
        or data-access duplicated across multiple components, think about refactoring that piece of logic or data-access
        code into a service. Using a service ensures we are not violating one of the Software principles - DRY ((Don't repeat
        yourself). The logic or data access is implemented once in a service, and the service can be used across all the
        components in our application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without the service you would have to repeat your code in each component. Imagine the overhead in terms of time and effort
        required to develop, debug, test and maintain the duplicated code across multiple places instead of having that duplicated
        code at one central place like a service and reusing that service where required.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating a service in Angular : We will be working with the same example that we have been working with so far in this video
        series. Add a new TypeScript file to the "employee" folder and name it employee.service.ts. Copy and paste the following
        code. At the moment we have the data hard-coded in the service method. In a later video we will discuss retrieving
        data from a remote server using HTTP.

        Difference between constructor and ngOnInit
      </h2>

      <p>
        A class constructor is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. It is generally used to initialise
        the fields of the class and it's sub classes.
      </p>

      <p>
        ngOnInit is a life cycle hook method provided by Angular. ngOnInit is called after the constructor and is generally used
        to perform tasks related to Angular bindings. For example, ngOnInit is the right place to call a service method to
        fetch data from a remote server. We can also do the same using a class constructor, but the general rule of thumb
        is, tasks that are time consuming should use ngOnInit instead of the constructor. As fetching data from a remote
        server is time consuming, the better place for calling the service method is ngOnInit.
      </p>

      <p>
        So coming back to our example, the dependency injection is done using the class constructor and the actual service method
        call is issued from ngOnInit life cycle hook as shown below
      </p>
