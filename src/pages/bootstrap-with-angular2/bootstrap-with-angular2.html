      <h2>Bootstrap with Angular2 </h2>

      <p>
        In this video we will discuss
        <br> 1. How to install and use Bootstrap with Angular
        <br> 2. How to enable intellisense for bootstrap in Visual Studio
      </p>

      <p>
        How to install and use Bootstrap with Angular : There are several ways to install Bootstrap. One way is by using Node.js
        command prompt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 1 : Open node.js command prompt window. s
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 2 : In the command prompt navigate to the folder that contains your angular project and type the following command and
        press enter key. As Bootstrap has a dependency on jQuery, we are installing jQuery as well.
        <br> npm install bootstrap@3 jquery --save
      </p>

      <p>
        This installs both Bootstrap and jQuery for use with our Angular project. The required Bootstrap and jQuery files are copied
        into the node_modules folder within the project directory.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fullpage_content">
      <p>
        Also, notice package.json file is also automatically updated with both the dependencies (Bootstrap and jQuery)
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 3 : Finally in index.html file add the following script and link elements to reference the required CSS and JS files.
        As you can see, these files are being served from the node_modules folder.
      </p>

      <expandable hideText="Hide the code" showText="See the code">
        <textarea class="codepart" cols="85" rows="5">
          <script src="/node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js">
          </script> 
          <link href="/node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" /> 
          <script src="/node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js">
          </script>
        </textarea>
      </expandable>

      <p>
        The problem at the moment is intellisense for Bootstrap CSS classes is not working in index.html, or any of the components
        html files
      </p>

      <h2>
        enable intellisense for bootstrap in Visual Studio.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Step 1 : In Visual Studio, click to select the Angular project and then click on "Show All Files" icon. You will then see
        "node_modules" folder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 2 : Expand "node_modules" folder. Locate "bootstrap" folder. Right click on it and select "Include In Project" option
        from the context menu.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point you should get bootstrap intellisense in index.html and all angular component html files. If you still do not
        get bootstrap intellisense, please restart Visual Stduio and you will get intellisense.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I said before, there are several ways to install bootstrap. One way is by using Node.js command prompt. The other way
        is by using Visual Stduio NuGet package manager. To install Bootstrap using NuGet package manager follow these steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 1 : In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right click on the Angular project and select "Manage NuGet Packages" option
        from the context menu
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 2 : In the "NuGet Package Manager" window Click on the "Browse" link In the textbox,
        <br> type "Bootstrap" and press "enter" key
        <br> Click on the first item which says - Bootstrap
        <br> Click on the arrow pointing downwards to install
      </p>

      <p>
        The required CSS and JS files are placed in Content and Script folders. Finally place the required CSS and JS files in index.html
        page to start using Bootstrap. If you install Bootstrap using NuGet you don't have to do anything else to get bootstrap
        intellisense.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do not want to download bootstrap, you can use their CDN links. You can find the official Bootstrap CDN links at the
        following page.

        <br>
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/" style="color: blue">http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides these 3 ways, there are other ways of installing Bootstrap. Which way to use depends on your project needs.
