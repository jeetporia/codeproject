      <h2>What is Lifecycle Hoooks in Angular 2</h2>
      <p>
        In this video we will discuss Angular component lifecycle hooks.
      </p>

      <p>
        A component has a lifecycle managed by Angular. Angular<br> 
        1. Creates the component <br>
        2. Renders the component <br>
        3. Creates and renders the component children <br>
        4. Checks when the component data-bound properties change, and<br>
        5. Destroys the component before removing it from the DOM
      </p>

      <p>
        To tap into and react when these life cycle events occur, angular offers several lifecycle hooks
      </p>

      <p>
        The 3 most commonly used hooks are <br>
        ngOnChanges - Executes, every time the value of an input property changes. 
        The hook method receives a SimpleChanges object containing current and previous property values. 
        This is called before ngOnInit. <br>
        ngOnInit - Executes after the constructor and after ngOnChange hook for the first time. 
        It is most commonly used for component initialisation and retrieving data from a database. <br>
        ngOnDestroy - Executes just before angular destroys the component and generally used for performing cleanup.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>
        If a class that implements the interface fails to provide implementation for all the interface members, the language compiler
        raises an error alerting the developer that something has been missed.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, an interface defines a contract (i.e the shape or structure of an API), that an implementing class must adhere
        to. Even in TypeScript we use the interface for the same purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        We know TypeScript is a strongly typed language. This means every property we define in a TypeScript class has a type associated
        with it. Similarly every method parameter and return type has a type. As you know by now, TypeScript has several
        built-in pre-defined types like string, number, boolean etc.
      </p> -->

      <!-- <p>
        However, the business objects that we usually create in real-world applications like Employee, Customer, Order, Invoice etc,
        does not have a pre-defined type. In this case, we can use an interface to create a custom type for our business
        object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice the below line of code in EmployeeListComponent class. The property "employees" is defined as an array of any type.
        <br> employees: any[];
      </p>

      <p>
        Since we don't have Type for the employee object, We will specified a type as any.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are 2 problems with the above line of code
        <br> 1. For the object properties in the array we do not get intellisense
        <br> 2. Since we do not get intellisense, we are prone to making typographical errors and the compiler will not be able
        to flag them as errors. We will come to know about these errors only at runtime.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's create a Type for employee using an interface as shown below. Add a new TypeScript file to the employee folder. Name
        it employee.ts. Copy and paste the following code.
      </p>

      <expandable hideText="Hide the code" showText="See the code">
        <textarea class="codepart" rows="5" cols="65">
          export interface IEmployee { 
            code: string; 
            name: string; 
            gender: string; 
            annualSalary: number; 
            dateOfBirth: string; 
          }
        </textarea>
      </expandable>

      <p>
        With this IEmployee interface in place, we can now import and use the interface type as the type for "employees" property.
        The code in EmployeeListComponent class is shown below.
      </p>

      <expandable hideText="Hide the code" showText="See the code">
        <textarea class="codepart" rows="5" cols="65">
          import { IEmployee } from './employee'; 
          
          export class EmployeeListComponent { 
            employees: IEmployee[]; 
          } 
        </textarea>
      </expandable>

      <p>
        Since we have specified a type for the "employees" property, we now get intellisense for the object properties in the array
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see from the image below, if we make any typographical errors with the property names, we will get to know these
        errors right away at compile time.
      </p>
      <h2>Interfaces in Typescript</h2>
      <p>
   
        <br> 1. Use interface keyword to create an interface
        <br> 2. It is common to prefix the interface name with capital letter I. However, some interfaces in Angular does not
        have the prefix I. For example, OnInit interface
        <br> 3. Interface members are public by default and does not require explicit access modifiers. It is a compile time
        error to include an explicit access modifier. You will see an error message like - public modifier cannot appear
        on a type member.
        <br> 4. A class that implements an interface must provide implementation for all the interface members unless the members
        are marked as optional using the ? operator
        <br> 5. Use the implements keyword to make a class implement an interface
        <br> 6. TypeScript interfaces exist for developer convenience and are not used by Angular at runtime. During transpilation,
        no JavaScript code is generated for an interface. It is only used by Typescript for type checking during development.
        <br> 7. To reduce the amount of code you have to write, consider using short-hand syntax to initialise class properties
        with constructor parameters
