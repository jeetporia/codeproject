      <h2>Angular promises vs observables</h2>
      <p>
        In this video we will discuss the differences between promises and observables. In Angular 2, to work with asynchronous data
        we can use either Promises or Observables. In our previous videos in this series, we discussed using both Observables
        and Promises. There are several differences between Promises and Observables. In this video let's discuss these differences.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Promise emits a single value where as an Observable emits multiple values over a period of time. You can think of an Observable
        like a stream which emits multiple items over a period of time and the same callback function is called for each
        item emitted. So with an Observable we can use the same API to handle asynchronous data whether that data is emitted
        as a single value or multiple values over a period of time.

      <p>
        A Promise is not lazy where as an Observable is Lazy.
        <br> A Promise cannot be cancelled where as an Observable can be cancelled using the unsubscribe() method
        <br> Observable provides operators like map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, retryWhen et
