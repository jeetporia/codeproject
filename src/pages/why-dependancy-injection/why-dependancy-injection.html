      <h2>Why Dependancy Injection</h2>

      <p>
        In this video we will discuss why should we use dependency injection and the benefits it provide. Let us understand this
        with a very simple example.
      </p>

      <p>
        We want to build a Computer. In reality to build a computer we need several objects like processor, ram, harddisk drive etc.
        To keep this example simple let's say we just need a processor object to build a computer.

      </p>

      <p>
        Our Computer and Processor classes are as shown below. Notice at the moment, we are not using dependency injection. To build
        a Computer we need a Processor object and the Computer class is creating an instance of the Processor class it needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are 3 fundamental problems with this code
        <br> 1. This code is difficult to maintain over time
        <br> 2. Instances of dependencies created by a class that needs those dependencies are local to the class and cannot
        share data and logic.
        <br> 3. Hard to unit test
      </p>

            export class Computer { 
              
              private processor: Processor; 
              constructor() { 
                this.processor = new Processor(); 
              } 
            } 
            
            export class Processor { 
              constructor() { 
              
            } 
          }

      <p>
        Now let us understand why this code is difficult to maintain. Let us say, the Processor class needs to know the speed of
        the processor to be able to create an inatnce of it. One way to address this requirement is by passing the processor
        speed as a parameter to the constructor of the Processor class as shown below.
      </p>

      <expandable hideText="Hide the code" showText="See the code">
        <textarea class="codepart" cols="65" rows="5">
            export class Processor 
            { 
              constructor(speed: number) {

               } 
            }
        </textarea>
      </expandable>

      <p>
        This change in the Processor class breaks the Computer class. So every time the Processor class changes, the Computer class
        also needs to be changed. At the moment, the Computer class has only one dependency. In reality it may have many
        dependencies and those dependencies inturn may have other dependencies. So when any of these dependencies change,
        the Computer class may also need to be changed. Hence this code is difficult to maintain.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason we have this problem is because the Computer class itself is creating the instance of the Processor class. Instead
        if an external source can create the processor instance and provide it to the computer class, then this problem can
        be very easily solved and that's exactly what dependency injection does. I have rewritten the above code using dependency
        injection, DI for short as shown below.
      </p>

        <textarea class="codepart" cols="65" rows="10">
            export class Computer { 
              
              private processor: Processor; 
              
              constructor(processor: Processor) { 
                this.processor = processor; 
              } 
            } 
            export class Processor {
              constructor(speed: number) {

               } 
            } 
        </textarea>
      </expandable>

      <p>
        Notice with DI, the Computer class is not creating the instance of the Processor class itself. Instead we have specified
        that the Computer class has a dependency on Processor class using the constructor. Now, when we create an instance
        of the Computer class, an external source i.e the Angular Injector will provide the instance of the Processor class
        to the Computer class. Since now the the Angular injector is creating the dependency instance, the Computer class
        need not change when the Processor class changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, let us understand the second problem - Instances of dependencies created by a class that needs those dependencies are
        local to the class and cannot share data and logic. The Processor class instance created in the Computer class is
        local to the Computer class and cannot be shared.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand if we use Dependency Injection (DI), the angular injector provides a Singleton i.e a single instance of
        the service so the data and logic can be shared very easily across all the components.
      </p>

      <p>
        From unit testing standpoint, it is difficult to mock the processor object, so unit testing Computer class can get complex.
        In this example, the Computer class has just one dependency (i.e the dependency on the Processor object).
      </p>

      <p>
        In a real world application, a given object may have a dependency on several other objects, and those dependencies inturn
        may have dependencies on other objects. Just imagine, how complicated unit testing can become with all these hierarchies
        of dependencies if we do not have the ability to mock the dependencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Dependency Injection it is very easy to mock objects when unit testing. This is one of the greatest benefits of DI.
